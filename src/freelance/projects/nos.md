The NOS (Dutch Broadcast Foundation) is like the Dutch BBC News. It has a special statutory obligation to make news and sports programs for Dutch public television and radio. The NOS also publishes news on its website nos.nl and related platforms.

> In 2008, modern interactive websites looked like this. It was a time without responsive design and a lot of blocks.

When I started at the NOS in the spring of 2008, I worked on the Olympics event website code. At that time, I was graduating for my bachelor’s degree in interaction design, and at the NOS I got the opportunity to help the team design the website.

From that point on, I was the UX designer of the New Media development team, and **together with the visual designers, we redesigned and reconceptualized all the NOS websites in the span of three years.** Everything from the news bulletin for kids [Jeugdjournaal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeugdjournaal) to the late-night news show [Nieuwsuur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuwsuur) and event websites like the national elections, the soccer World Cup, and the yearly Tour de France.

I also got the opportunity to **design the first iPhone and Android app for the NOS in 2012**. That app got featured two years in a row by Apple as an ‘app jewel’ during their winter holiday highlights (Dutch: [NOS beste nieuws-app 2013](https://nos.nl/artikel/587606-apple-nos-beste-nieuws-app-2013.html)). At that time, it was the only Dutch app featured as an app jewel.

During my time at the NOS, I transitioned from a coder who could design to a full-time designer and usability consultant. I got the opportunity to experiment with apps for TV, different audiences, and modular design within an ever-changing organization with a high impact on society.

As you can imagine, I had the time of my life.
