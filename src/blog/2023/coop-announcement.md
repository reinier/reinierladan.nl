![If you got that OKR stuck in your agile again, call Kirk and Blackbeard](/images/kb-announcement.jpg)

Freelancing can be a lonely endeaver. Despite the many advantages it offers, this aspect has been a challenge for me that I have been eager to address for some time now. I believe a set of shared values, mutual assistance, and the pursuit of a common objective can be of great professional value.

Fortunately, there were some people I've known for a long time that were looking for the same thing and they wanted me to join them in their cooperative business. **As of now I'm a proud member of [Kirk & Blackbeard](https://kirkandblackbeard.com/) where we provide hands-on leadership and expert guidance for organizations seeking to craft and grow their digital products.** We get stuff done.

Whether you need the steady hand of a captain or the daring spirit of a pirate, weâ€™re here to support you every step of the way as we navigate the ever-changing digital waters.

**And we're open for work.** And at the very least open for a cup of coffee. Call Kirk and let's get it done.
