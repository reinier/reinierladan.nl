When I was asked to design the NPO.nl website, the domain had just been purchased from the [Nederlandse Postduiven Organisatie for 100.000 euros]((https://www.nu.nl/internet/2778791/publieke-omroep-koopt-nponl-100000-euro.html)). At the time, the NPO brand was quite fragmented and largely unknown as the origin of great quality TV to the Dutch public. 

The goal was to design a proper streaming service for NPO by consolidating the television and radio websites, as well as the on-demand TV site Uitzending Gemist. This led to a consistent product and brand experience, and ensured that NPO was future-proof.

[The current NPO.nl](https://npo.nl/) still holds the DNA of the 'NPO streaming service' we started back then and is one of the most popular sites in The Netherlands.
