[NLZiet](https://nlziet.nl) is _the_ app where every Dutch TV station is available to watch, both live and on-demand.

In 2014, I was asked to oversee the design of the NLZiet launch app for Android and iOS. It was an extremely interesting project as RTL, SBS, and NPO were sitting together with various interests at play. Within the clear scope that was set by each stakeholder, we managed to create an app where the content was made available within the constraints of each broadcaster. Stakeholder management from a design perspective was a big part of this project.
