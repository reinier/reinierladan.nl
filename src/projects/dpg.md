[DPG Media](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPG_Media) is a large player in the online and offline content publication space in Belgium and the Netherlands.

At DPG, my objective was to give the single-interest brands (such as vtwonen, Autoweek, and Ouders van Nu) a new multi-tenant digital platform from which to build a modern and user-friendly future. Within the project (internally called 'Jupiter'), a new agnostic frontend was designed, a new CMS was built, and the platform was linked to existing DPG systems for content management, IAM service and advertising.

As the product owner, I set up this platform for migration from the old environment to the new platform, together with the development team, internal business stakeholders, and the brands themselves.

This new platform also positions DPG to launch new brands, with in-depth interaction with the target audience and extensive content on a specific topic as important components of the vision and strategy.
